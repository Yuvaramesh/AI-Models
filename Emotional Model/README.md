## The AI Model is build using AI Tool called TeachableMachine


1. **Emotional AI Model:***
   - A machine learning or deep learning model designed to recognize and classify emotions in textual data based on the presence of emojis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - The process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.

3. **Emoji Recognition:**
   - The ability of the model to identify and associate specific emotions with emojis in the input text.

4. **Dataset:**
   - A collection of textual data samples used for training and evaluating the model.

5. **Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning and transformation tasks performed on the raw dataset before training the model, including tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stop words.

6. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
   - A numerical statistic used to reflect the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents, often employed in feature extraction for text data.

7. **Word Embeddings:**
   - A representation of words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.

8. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):**
   - A type of neural network architecture designed to process sequential data, such as text.

9. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**
   - A specific type of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

10. **Dependencies:**
    - External libraries and packages required for the project to run, typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

11. **Training Model:**
    - The process of feeding the model with labeled data and adjusting its parameters to learn the patterns and relationships in the data.

12. **Evaluation:**
    - Assessing the performance of the trained model on a separate dataset to measure its accuracy and generalization ability.

13. **Predictions:**
    - Inference using the trained model to predict the emotions in new, unseen text data.

14. **Contributing:**
    - Encouraging others to contribute to the project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or code improvements.
